# Towcester Cycling Club

## Website for a local cycling club

## Project Requirements

In this project, you’ll build a webpage for a local club. You can base it on real-life
organization you belong to or make one up! You’ll get to choose everything about your page:
the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that you want to use, and more!

Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you learned.
In our example project, we use percentages and relative units, such as em and rem,
in our CSS to size and position page elements.

- Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
- Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
- Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.

## Project Plan

Create a locally hosted single page website that will display images and content for
a local cycling club, including images, nav with links and links to other local businesses.

The website must be responsive and ensure all device types can view the page properly.
The site will be created for mobile then scaled up to tablet and desktop in CSS.

The site will be managed with Git version control
The site will use command line in Powershell to commit changes or rollback if required
